# P2-SmithK

### Checkpoint 1
I decided to go with the approach of create 2 seperate lists one with values and one with weights, just because it seemed easy at the time. I may have to go change that down the line.

### Conclusions
- Did your experience any issues when creating the baseline values: I did not personally experience any issues when making baseline values. I did have to change the way I was generating my values.
- Present each graph. Explain the performance and any anomalies.

- What baseline values/strategies would you use to improve your understanding of the algorithms: I suppose I would use the same stratagies I used in this project
- If you allowed weights that were not integer values, how would that affect the performance of the three algorithms: I imagine it wouldn't change very much besides take a little longer for the algorithm to run.
