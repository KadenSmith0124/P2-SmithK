# P2-SmithK

### Checkpoint 1
I decided to go with the approach of create 2 seperate lists one with values and one with weights, just because it seemed easy at the time. I may have to go change that down the line.

### Conclusions
- Did your experience any issues when crea3ng the baseline values?
- Present each graph. Explain the performance and any anomalies.
- What baseline values/strategies would you use to improve your understanding of the algorithms?
- If you allowed weights that were not integer values, how would that affect the performance of the three algorithms?
